# BIDS-validator for computational data (BEP034)

This is a package for validating computational data conversion, specifically designed using [BEP034 proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NT1ERdL41oz3NibIFRyVQ2iR8xH-dKY-lRCB4eyVeRo/edit?usp=sharing).

The package was specifically designed for [sim2bids app](https://github.com/dissagaliyeva/sim2bids), however, you can check your own computational conversions as well. 

The project is very fresh and under active development. However, you can already get most of the checks. 

### Installation

Simply run the following command to get the app up and running:
